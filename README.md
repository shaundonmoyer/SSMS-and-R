## SQL Review
Structured query language or SQL is a programming language used for editing and querying information within different 
database managment systems. The SQL language is base off of several different elements. These elements can be executed
by command line interface in most databse management systems, in my case I am using an SSMS. These elements include...

* Expressions – Produce scalar values or tables, made up of rows and columns of data.
* Clauses – These are the components of different queries and statements.
* Queries – Queries can retrieve data based on the provided criteria.
* Predicates – These specify conditions that are used to limit the effects of Queries and Statements or to change the flow of the entire program.
* Statements – With statements, the data handler is able to control program flow, transactions, sessions, connecntions and diagnostics.

Essentially, SQL is the main language that allows allows your database server to store and edit data within it.
